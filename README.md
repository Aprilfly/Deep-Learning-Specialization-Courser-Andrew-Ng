# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## About myself and my purpose for taking this course 

**VERBOSE CONTENT WARNING: YOU CAN JUMP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU WANT**

As a student studying data analytics at the Univerisity of Texas at San Antonio. December I will be graduating with my masters degree and this deep learning course was an additional self-study course on top of the material of the program. The purpose of me creating a repo for this course was to showcase the skills taught through the course and allow my skills to shine. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. There are discussion forums on most MOOC platforms, however, even a question with detailed description may need some time to be answered. Here I released these solutions, which are **only for your reference purpose**.  

For those who are looking at the code for help or assistance, please don't copy any part of the code. The programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully, see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure. This course is almost the simplest deep learning course I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure given by deeplearning.ai team.

This course has 5 parts, or 5 courses that vary from 2-4 weeks long. Each week ends in a quiz as well as a programming exercise.
